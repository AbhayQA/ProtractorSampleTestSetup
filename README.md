# ProtractorSampleTestSetup
A sample work on setting up Protractor Test Automation framework for Angular Web apps.
Import the project in an environment with Node, Protractor installed and you are ready to execute.

I have defined 2 scenarios with 4 cases, created a UTIL class for common used methods and a json file for storing page objects.
Overall, this framework gives Test scripting, page object concept, data driven capabilities & reporting.
